## Brief Intro of the Current Project

This project is a recipe site that includes 3 recipes that I would like to bake in December.
I have chosen austrian desserts which are inspired by my wonderful austrian girlfriend.

This my first project completing the Odin Project Foundations course. It is not intended to look nice.

## Skills Involved:

- Making lists (ul and ol)
- Headings and paragraphs
- images and alt text
- absolute and relative links
- git practice

All only in HTML so far
